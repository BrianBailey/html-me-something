					  <h2>SciKit Learn</h2>
					  <p>I have been very interested with computer programming for the last 8 years or so.  I took the class for CS50 and had some personal family issues come up so I was not able to finish the class.   It sparked a curiousity in me and the power of what code could do;   especially with different data sets.  I started out using Ruby and built a Rails application.   Ruby is not very data friendly or should I say,  does not have the libraries built out quite like Python.   I fell in love with the python programming language about 2 years ago.   It was very similar to Ruby but the data munging libraries are absolutely brilliant.  The more I started to code in this ,   it naturally led me to machine learning and the main library for this is Scikit Learn.</p>

						    <h2>Matplotlib</h2>
							<p>The more you get into manipulating data the more you want to actually be able to visualize all of this data.   The library matplotlib is excellent for this.   It also is built into the SciPy stack and you can see some incredible data plotted out that is worth "thousands of words and comments".</p>

					  <p>I recently started going through some tutorials.   One of the first ones is going to be the iris data set.   Using a library like numpy,  you are able to organize and visualize all the data in this csv file.  I want to continue practicing machine learning.   It is a lot of work to start to understand the algorithms that are used but I believe this is all definitely the future of harnessing the power of computers.</p>

					    <h2>Cool example of ML</h2>
					    <p>There are going to be so many incredible uses for machine learning.   It is going to be used in every industry.  I did a talk about parsing data to a Ruby meetup.   The figure below goes into how hedge funds are able to use a helicopter with a camera attached and be able to track the levels of oil in oil tanks.   They said that with machine learning,   this could be programmed to notice what times are the best for this and to be able to use arbitrage on the data in different parts of the world.   So exciting. </p>
